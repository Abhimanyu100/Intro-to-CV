### Installations

1. Python v2.7 (v3.5 shall also do. However a little change in code would be required)


2. OpenCV 2 -

  * http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html
(For Mac/Linux users, any issue while declaring a $PATH variable can be handled during the session, if any situation may arise)

  * For Mac users, better installation procedures are given in - http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/

  * For Linux and Python 3 users, a shell script has been attached which completes the installation in half an hour. To run it
```sh
sh openCV.sh
```



3. Libraries -

For installing other libraries, use

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

For Python 3.x, change pip to pip3
